# MyAngularUIPOC

Small POC on designing angual app with material standards that has generic search criteria capabilities, charting options and plug/play API end points dynamically. 
This POC was done to take it forward to my client environment for replacing EXAGO based Angular1 UIs with modernized device agnostic framework.
